//! `Layout` — the factored, readable store path for a leaf.
//!
//! The leaf's identity is the *ordered tuple of per-level hashes along its
//! path*; the store path is a readable nested **factoring** of that identity,
//! not a flat blob dir, so `list`/`show`/`cat` keep working. Each path
//! segment is `{label}-{hash8}`: the label is **provenance** (a rename → a
//! new dir → a harmless cache miss, never a wrong answer) and the `hash8` is
//! **identity** (the level's `ContentHash`, first 4 bytes as 8 hex). Eight
//! hex chars per segment suffices — a collision needs *every* level on the
//! path to collide simultaneously, and `run.json` records the full 64-char
//! hashes for verification.
//!
//! Navigation and display read `run.json`, never these segments. The store
//! ([`crate::store`]) appends a `~{disambiguator}` to the final segment on a
//! `PathPrefixCollision`; `Layout` always produces the base form, and the
//! reader enumerates sibling dirs rather than reconstructing names — so a
//! `~`-suffixed sibling is found like any other leaf.
